		      Each participating team must submit an on-line
		      abstract for the EWRI 2017 congress
		      (www.ewricongress.org) that discusses briefly
		      the proposed approach (e.g., machine learning
		      techniques, Kalman filer-based approaches,
		      CUSUM-based methodologies etc.).  When
		      submitting the abstract, <strong>the topic area
		      must be identified as "BATtle of the Attack
		      Detection ALgorithms (BATADAL)"</strong> - this
		      will identify your team of authors as a
		      participant in the competition. Once an abstract
		      has been submitted to BATADAL as described
		      above, forward a copy of the abstract to
		      Riccardo Taormina, Stefano Galelli and Nils
		      Tippenhauer
		      (see <a href="organizers.html">contact
		      data</a>). A package of problem data and network
		      model will be forwarded to all authors
		      submitting abstracts that describe an attack
		      detection approach.  Authors are asked not to
		      forward the problem data and network model to
		      non-participants, so that the organizers can
		      maintain a reliable participant list. Each team
		      must summarize their final design results in a
		      brief congress paper, which must be uploaded
		      to the same web site no later than January 9,
		      2017
		      (see <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a>). All
		      conforming designs will be included in the
		      public presentation of summary results at the
		      congress and will be published as part of the
		      congress proceedings.  Submitted papers
		      describing the final designs from each team
		      should be brief and to the point. It is not
		      necessary to describe the competition, as that
		      will be included in the summary comparison
		      paper. Each paper should briefly state that it
		      is part of the BATtle of the Attack Detection
		      ALgorithms (BATADAL) competition.  To allow
		      efficient and fair assessment of contributed
		      algorithms, papers submitted to BATADAL are
		      asked to include the following sections:
		      Abstract; Introduction (brief); Methodology;
		      Summary of results for the first two datasets
		      ; Conclusions; and References.  The
		      submission of the detection report to the
		      organizers is compulsory - reports submitted
		      with incomplete information may be excluded from
		      the comparison.  Participants have the option to
		      submit a revised paper to EWRI congress to
		      include the results on the test dataset.
