		    <h3>Problem Setting</h3>		    
		    <p>
		      C-Town Public Utility (CPU) is the main water
		      distribution system operator of C-Town
		      (Figure 1). For many years, CPU has
		      operated a static distribution topology. In the
		      last year, CPU has introduced novel smart
		      technology to enable remote data collection from
		      sensors in the field, and remote control of
		      actuators. Shortly after that new technology has
		      been introduced, anomalous low levels in Tank T5
		      and high levels in Tank T1 were observed. A
		      month later, a water overflow in Tank T1
		      occurred. While CPU personnel at the control
		      center were able to see the anomalous readings
		      for the first two episodes, Tank T1 overflow
		      took place unexpectedly while the water level
		      readings were always below the alarm thresholds
		      and pumping operations appeared to be
		      normal. Searching for the causes, CPU engineers
		      suspect potential cyber-attacks for all these
		      episodes. In particular, they are considering
		      adversaries that are able to activate and
		      deactivate the actuators in C-Town, as well as
		      altering the readings of the sensors deployed in
		      the network and the reported status of
		      actuators, and interfering with the connections
		      established between networked components. The
		      participants' task is thus to develop an online
		      alert system for cyber-physical attacks.

		    <h3>Goal of the attack detection algorithms</h3>
		    <p>
The primary goal of the detection mechanism is to reliably detect the
presence of an ongoing attack from the SCADA readings, and to do so in
the shortest amount of time. In addition, the algorithm should avoid
false alarms and recognize when the threat is no longer in place. Due
to the distributed nature of the WDS, an ideal detection mechanism
should also be able to identify which components of the physical
network are being attacked in order to facilitate and hasten incident
resolution. Furthermore, the inherent interdependence of the elements
in the water network should theoretically allow for the detection of
anomalies even when the adversary tries to conceal his actions by
altering the SCADA readings of one or a few deployed sensors. The
control system will operate in the control room, based on the
available SCADA data. Further information is detailed in the rules document.

		    <h3>Test data and evaluation criteria</h3>
		    <p>
A test dataset will be made available for a short time window
(<a href="schedule.html">see schedule</a>), during which the
participants are required to run their algorithms and submit a
detection report (see rules document for further details). The test
dataset will contain a few months of data and contain attack instances
that may differ from those of the development dataset. All algorithms
will then be compared by adopting quantitative criteria based on the
time-to-detection and events classification (confusion matrix), as
outlined below.
