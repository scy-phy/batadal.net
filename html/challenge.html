		    <p>In the following, we briefly summarize the design challenge. The full set of official rules will are available through the following link.</p><p> <a href="images/rules.pdf" class="button">Official Rules Document</a></p>
		    <h3>Problem Setting</h3>		    
		    <p>
		      C-Town Public Utility (CPU) is the main water
		      distribution system operator of C-Town
		      (Fig. 1). For many years, CPU has operated a
		      fixed distribution network topology.  In the
		      last year, CPU has introduced novel smart
		      technology to enable remote data collection from
		      sensors in the field, and remote control of
		      actuators.  Several months after that new
		      technology has been introduced, a major overflow
		      in Tank T1 occurred. Shortly after, anomalous
		      low levels in Tank T5 were noticed.  While CPU
		      personnel at SCADA were able see the anomalous
		      readings for the latter episode, Tank T1
		      overflow took place unexpectedly while the T1
		      water level readings were always below the alarm
		      thresholds. Searching for the causes, CPU
		      engineers suspect potential cyber-attacks for
		      both episodes.  In particular, they are
		      considering adversary profiles that are able to
		      activate and deactivate the actuators in C-Town,
		      as well as altering the readings of the sensors
		      deployed in the network and interfering with the
		      connections established between networked
		      components.

		    <h3>Development data</h3>
		    <p>
		      CPU will provide the participants with the following data.
		      <ul class="fa-ul">
			<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>C-Town model in EPANET input format.  Short description of C
			  -Town with PLCs?</li>
			<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Historical data for the last two years before the smart devices were introduced.
			  <ul  class="fa-ul">
			    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>The data is taken hourly, and provided in monthly intervals</li>
			    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>The first two years of data are guaranteed to be without attacks</li>
			    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>This data can be used to derive parameters related to normal system operations</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
			<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Historical data for several months since the smart devices were introduced
			  <ul class="fa-ul">
			    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>The data is taken hourly, and provided in monthly intervals</li>
			    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>The data is not guaranteed to be without attacks</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
			<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square"></i>Historical data for the last month, which includes the suspected attack that caused a tank overflow</li>
		      </ul>

		    <h3>Goal of the attack detection algorithms</h3>
		    <p>
		      The  primary  goal  of  the  detection  mechanism  is  to  reliably detect  the  presence  of  an  ongoing attack. Give technical details here ...
		    </p>
		  </section>
		  <section>
		    <h3>Test data and evaluation criteria</h3>
		    <p>
		      A testing  dataset  will be  made available  for a  short time window,  during  which the participants are required to test their algorithms and submit  a detection report (see below for further details).  
		      The test dataset will contain attack types  that  may diff
		      er from those of the  development  dataset.
		      All algorithms will be then compared according to the following
		      set of evaluation criteria.
