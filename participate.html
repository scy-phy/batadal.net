		      The problem data are available on this
		      website. Interested participants should
		      contact <a href="organizers.html">the
		      organizers</a>) to receive a username and
		      password - the data section of BATADAL website
		      is password-protected.  Each participating team
		      must submit an on-line abstract for EWRI 2017
		      conference
		      (<a href="http://www.ewricongress.org">www.ewricongress.org</a>)
		      that discusses briefly the proposed approach
		      (e.g., machine learning techniques, Kalman
		      filer-based approaches, CUSUM-based
		      methodologies etc.). When submitting the
		      abstract, the topic area must be identified as
		      "Water Distribution Systems Analysis
		      Symposium-BATtle of the Attack Detection
		      ALgorithms (BATADAL)" - this will identify your
		      team as a participant in the competition.

		      Each team must summarize its final
		      results in a conference paper, which must be
		      uploaded to the same website no later than
		      January 9, 2017. All conforming results will be
		      included in the public presentation at the
		      conference and will be published as part of the
		      conference proceedings. Submitted papers should
		      be brief and to the point. It is not necessary
		      to describe the competition, as that will be
		      included in the summary comparison paper. Each
		      paper should briefly state that it is part of
		      the BATtle of the Attack Detection ALgorithms
		      (BATADAL) and include the following sections:
		      Abstract; Introduction (brief); Methodology;
		      Summary of results for the first two datasets
		      (see rules document for details); Conclusions; and References. 

		      The submission of the detection report
		      based on the test dataset is
		      compulsory - reports submitted with incomplete
		      information may be excluded from the
		      comparison. Note that the test dataset released
		      on February 20, 2017, will not include labeled
		      attacks, and will be used for ranking the
		      designed algorithms. Once all detection reports
		      have been received, the attack labels will be
		      released. This will give the option to the
		      participants to submit an optional revised
		      version of their paper that includes the results
		      on the test dataset (to be confirmed by EWRI
		      2017 organizers).
